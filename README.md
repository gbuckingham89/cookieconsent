This is a simple JavaScript cookie consent script that displays a yellow warning bar at the top of the page to inform users that cookies are in use based on "implied consent". I didn't plan on releasing this, so it is something that has just been thrown together quickly - there is plenty of room for improvement!

It isn't a jQuery plugin, so there an no options per-se, but variables can be changed in the source. There is a hard coded URL to the CSS file - make sure you remember to change this for your server. It should be quite self explanatory, but if you have any questions, let me know.

Feel free to use this as you wish.
